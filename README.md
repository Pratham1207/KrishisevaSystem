**KrishiSevaSystem** is an integrated smart agriculture platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The system supports multiple user roles, with a dedicated **Admin Panel**, **Client Site** for farmers and users, and a centralized **Backend API**. Core modules include Cold Storage booking, Plant and Soil Monitoring, PDF report generation, and secure authentication.
